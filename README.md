# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation Project

## Introduction
### The main motivation behind building this project was to enhance my skills using python and postgresql
The issue this project addresses is: When the data is coming from a variety of sources it makes it difficult to store, access, analyse and may result in uninformed business decisions.
The solution to this will be making a system that is able to accomodate all the data into one single database which will be serving as a central source for all the questions the business wants.
Tools like postgresql are very powerful in terms of their speed and performace. Hence, before storing the data into this database it is better to clean and check for any errors the data might have. To do this I have used python, then I have uploaded the cleaned data into the central database.
The project involves variety of tools and data in diffrent formats which makes it interesting.
