# You will need clean the user data, look out for NULL values, errors with dates, incorrectly typed values and rows filled with the wrong information.


# Step 7:

# Now create a method in your DatabaseConnector class called upload_to_db. This method will take in a Pandas DataFrame and table name to upload to as an argument.


# Step 8:

# Once extracted and cleaned use the upload_to_db method to store the data in your sales_data database in a table named dim_users.
